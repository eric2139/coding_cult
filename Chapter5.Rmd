# int stands for integers.
# dbl stands for doubles, or real numbers.
# chr stands for character vectors, or strings.
# dttm stands for date-times (a date + a time).

#lgl stands for logical, vectors that contain only TRUE or FALSE.
#fctr stands for factors, which R uses to represent categorical variables  with fixed possible values.
#date stands for dates.

# Definition
# (filter()): Pick observations by their values.
# (arrange()): Reorder the rows.
# (select()): Pick variables by their names.
# (mutate()): Create new variables with functions of existing variables.
# (summarise()): Collapse many values down to a single summary.

# group_by(): which changes the scope of each function from operating on     the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group.


# These six functions provide the verbs for a language of data manipulation.

# All verbs work similarly:
#1) The first argument is a data frame.
#2) The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame, using the variable names (without quotes).
#3 The result is a new data frame.

filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))

# When you’re starting out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to use = instead of == when testing for equality. When this happens you’ll get an informative error:
filter(flights, month = 1)
# Result: > Error: `month` (`month = 1`) must not be named, do you need `==`?

# There’s another common problem you might encounter when using ==: floating point numbers.
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
# Answer: > [1] FALSE
1 / 49 * 49 == 1
# Answer: > [1] FALSE

# Computers use finite precision arithmetic (they obviously can’t store an infinite number of digits!) so remember that every number you see is an approximation. Instead of relying on ==, use near():
near(sqrt(2) ^ 2,  2)
# Answer: > [1] TRUE
near(1 / 49 * 49, 1)
# Answer: > [1] TRUE

filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)

filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)

# One important feature of R that can make comparison tricky are missing values, or NAs (“not availables”). NA represents an unknown value so missing values are “contagious”: almost any operation involving an unknown value will also be unknown.

NA > 5
# AnswerL > [1] NA
10 == NA
# AnswerL > [1] NA
NA + 10
# AnswerL > [1] NA
NA / 2
# AnswerL > [1] NA

# The most confusing result is this one:
NA == NA
# > [1] NA

# It’s easiest to understand why this is true with a bit more context:
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA
# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA
# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y
#> [1] NA
# We don't know!

# If you want to determine if a value is missing, use is.na():
is.na(x)
# > [1] TRUE

# filter() only includes rows where the condition is TRUE; it excludes both FALSE and NA values. If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
# > # A tibble: 1 x 1
# >       x
# >   <dbl>
# > 1     3
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
# > # A tibble: 2 x 1
# >       x
# >   <dbl>
# > 1    NA
# > 2     3
