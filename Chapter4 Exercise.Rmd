```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_varıable
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_varıable' not found

# The error on why it won't work/not suppposed to is that the i in variable is different.
```

ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```

```{r}
# Answer:
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```
